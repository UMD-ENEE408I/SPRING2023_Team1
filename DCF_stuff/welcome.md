# Welcome to Dilan's folder

Here, I am currently working on the OpenCV portion of the project

Hopefully, this personal log of occurences will prove useful down  
the line as we work on the final report and the weeklies. *(Also  
this is just an excuse to learn Markdown xdd)*  

### Week of 3-17-2023

## Tasks completed
*Successfully got the camera calibrated*  

This was pretty challenging, since I had to get into the weeds of  
how the OpenCV library worked. Regardless, I went ahead and added  
comments on what certain functions returned, what were their params,  
etc. This is with the hope that, as the project advances, everyone  
is on the same page and understands how the technology works.  


## Tasks to be completed
*Calculate distance between tags IRL*  

Now that the camera is properly calibrated, we can move on to the  
question of distance calculation. Some potential challenges may  
be the camera itself, which is ~~dog shit~~ of lesser quality.  
Currently, the camera does not detect tags farther than about a  
yard, which may limit the size in which we can run the game, in  
turn making for a very boring demo. To remedy this, there are some  
articles on how to increase the range of the detection by using CV  
*M A G I C*. More likely, we'll just do the top-down view plan, as  
we can just use a calibrated webcam. It might even make the distance  
calculations more straightforward.
